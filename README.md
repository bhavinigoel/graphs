The knapsack problem involves selecting a subset of items from a set, each with a weight and a value, to maximize the total value while keeping the total weight within a given limit (the "knapsack capacity"). There are various versions of the knapsack problem, including the 0/1 knapsack problem and the fractional knapsack problem, each with different constraints and solution approaches.

    two adjacent vertices have the same color, using at most 'n' colors. This implementation utilizes a backtracking algorithm to explore all possible colorings and finds a valid solution if one exists.

 26.  n_queens.cpp :This program solves the N-Queens problem, a classic combinatorial problem where the objective is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, no two
